<p>I&#39;m a pretty big reader -- I usually have 3-4 different books in-progress at any given time. I dabble in any genre, but particularly enjoy reading books about history, tech, science, and programming. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, as life has gotten busier, I&#39;ve started reading less. In addition, I find that when I do read, I can often tend to forget much of what I read and my memory isn&#39;t quite as photographic as it used to be. There are myriad reasons that I think are at the root of this, and I suspect that being constantly immersed in digital distractions is probably the most significant cause. </p>
<p>To help remember important parts of books, I&#39;ve tried lots of different strategies. Reading aloud, using a highlighter, taking notes, audiobooks, and more. I have found that for technical books, I remember and digest information best when I read with a highlighter or pen and take notes on important topics. </p>
<p>I&#39;m going to start posting my reading notes here. I anticipate this will help me do several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build up content for my new website</li>
<li>Be able to access my (published) notes anywhere I have an internet connection</li>
<li>Be able to take advantage of markdown formatting to better track code snippets</li>
<li>Learn in public and hold myself accountable to keep reading and taking notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, I&#39;m focusing on two books, <a href="https://amzn.to/3WXfxER"><em>Concurrency in Go</em> by the outstanding Katherine Cox-Buday</a>* and a book about American Interventionism in the Middle East whose name escapes me at the moment! I&#39;ll focus on sharing notes from <em>Concurrency in Go</em> for now. I&#39;m currently on Chapter 3, so I&#39;ll start by uploading my notes from the first two chapters. Shoot me a <a href="https://x.com/tylerschade">Tweet/Xeet</a> if you want to discuss or follow along.</p>
