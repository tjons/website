    <h2>Boundaries, Interactions, Guarantees</h2>
    <p class="content">
        A few weeks ago, I found myself trying to explain "smell-testing" designs to an engineer who leads one of the teams I work with. 
        In my role as a distinguished engineer, I work across several departments and teams. There's one team I technically "own" and manage
        their day to day work. I review all their PRs, write substantial code for the project myself, and am accountable for delivery and planning. There's
        another team that I provide oversight to, by serving as an system architect and decision maker. Then there's other teams that I work with, less closely,
        as needs may arise.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        This engineer was expressing overwhelm about how the project he is trying to lead is so different from what he's seen in his 20+ years in the industry.
        I empathize. Everything is a little different, everywhere, and nothing fits together quite like you'd expect. He asked me how I can confidently make 
        decisions without having the time to work through each problem myself in depth. I encouraged him to practice smell-testing, and he looked a little confused.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Later that night, I was walking to dinner and found myself attempting to explain this to ZoÃ«. She asked: "what do you mean, smell test?". I paused, and
        then formulated three principals that I try to use when I smell test.
        <ul>
            <li>Boundaries</li>
            <li>Interactions</li>
            <li>Guarantees</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Boundaries</h3>
    <p class="content">
        When I look at a system, whether existing or new and yet to be implement, I try to analyze the boundaries. Boundaries are the edges - the outer part of the 
        scope of the intended system. Are the boundaries too broad? Is this system trying to manage too many things? Conversely, are the boundaries too narrow? Sometimes
        a perfectly good system can fail because it was designed for far too narrow a scope, relative to the problem this system is intended to solve. $EXAMPLE.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        Unfortunately, boundary analysis is entirely a "feel" thing. It's hard for me to quantify, and I'm not sure that I'm qualified to teach it; however, I know that
        when I look at a new system I haven't seen before, the first thing I do as part of smell testing is examine the boundaries.
