        <p>Currently, I'm sitting in a coffeeshop in Miami, converting this site from Jekyll (which was overkill and annoying for my needs) to raw html and css. I've just wrapped up a <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6873">contribution</a> to <a href="https://openpolicyagent.org">OPA</a>, an open-source project I'm a regular contributor too, and I'm sipping some lovely espresso with ZoÃ« by my side.</p>
        <p>I just got back from four days in Alaska, which was an astoundingly beautiful last-miunte trip Alex and I took last weekend. I did backcountry hiking in Denali State Park, Denali National Park and Hatcher Pass. On the fourth day I got to ride downhill MTB at Alyeska Resort on the Turnagain arm. Alaska is by far the most gorgeous place I've ever been and I'm looking forward to returning.</p>
        <p>I'm still reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3WXfxER"><i>Concurrency in Go</i></a>, with about 45 pages left to go.</p>
